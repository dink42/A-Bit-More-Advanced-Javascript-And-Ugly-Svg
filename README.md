> ### Im learning git and github, im currently refreshing my .md files to make more sense.

1. This is a project wich started as a assaignment in school, but later added alot of functions just playing around to learn how to work with the DOM and using eventlisteners.
   - Styling buttons, using global variables.
     - It's not the finest I have done, a bit messy, but it's the functions wich are important here.
   
### As always, feel free to rech out to me!
